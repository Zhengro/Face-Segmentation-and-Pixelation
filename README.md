# Face-Segmentation-and-Pixelation
For protecting privacy, people used to blur faces in the photos by hand when posting them. However, this process could be time-consuming and exhausting when there are massive photos need to be handled. Therefore, we try to obtain mosaic faces automatically with the help of face segmentation, which is inspired by [Splash of Color](https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46) and [Mask-RCNN Shiny](https://github.com/huuuuusy/Mask-RCNN-Shiny). In this project, we will investigate face segmentation using [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to generate masks of faces and then pixelate only the facial areas indicated by the masks. Both **_code_** and **_results_** are available in the [notebook](https://github.com/Zhengro/Face-Segmentation-and-Pixelation/blob/master/Face_Segmentation_and_Pixelation.ipynb).
## Dataset
Since the original implementation of Mask R-CNN is pre-trained on MS COCO dataset which does not contain face class, we needed to train our model on another dataset for face segmentation. Initially, we found a [dataset](https://dataturks.com/projects/devika.mishra/face_detection) for detecting faces in images released by DataTurks. It has around 500 images with around 1100 faces manually tagged via bounding box. But it doesn't provide information of masks. Thus, we had to manually add mask annotations for each image in the dataset. We used VGG Image Annotator ([VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)) to annotate images to fit in this project, which is given by [face_detection_200.json](https://github.com/Zhengro/Face-Segmentation-and-Pixelation/blob/master/face_detection_200.json). Finally, we picked a total of 200 images and randomly split them into a train set and a validation set, with a 90-10 split.
